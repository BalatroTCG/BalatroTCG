# Balatro Mod

WARNING: This is a side project, I will be updating this slowly, and this project is a spaghetti code mess.  This has multiplayer support but only works with a custom server that's in the source files.

## How it works:
- Buy any jokers or consumables from your hand.
- Optionally select one of your opponents jokers to attack
- Play or discard until your hands have run out.
- Your score determines your damage.
  - The damage you deal is the square of the final chip's e
  - 10 = 1 damage, 125 = 4 damage, 5.23e9 = 81 damage, etc.
- First person to bankrupt loses

## TODO:
- Update more jokers to be useable
- Fix some weird bugs in the server code
- Finish the AI features to be not stupid
- Convince the Balatro Multiplayer people to add support natively to their server???
- Add a system to determine who goes first
