## Balatro Mod

WARNING: This is a side project, I will be updating this slowly, and this project is a spaghetti code mess.  This has multiplayer support but only works with a custom server that's in the source files.

# TODO:
- Update more jokers to be useable
- Fix some weird bugs in the server code
- Finish the AI features to be not stupid
- Convince the Balatro Multiplayer people to add support natively to their server???
